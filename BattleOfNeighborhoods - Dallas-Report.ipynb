    "## Project Description:\n",
    "Whenever people move to any other place, they explore the place and try to fetch as much information as possible about it. It can be the neighborhood, locality, market, price of the place and many more factors including neighborhood analysis. This is can be termed as request for a search algorithm which usually returns the requested features such as population rate, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational facilities etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be beneficial and nice to have an application which could make easy by considering a comparative analysis between the neighborhood with provided factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project helps the end user or the stakeholder to achieve the results which will not only recommend but also saves a lot of time in manual search. This will indeed save the time and money of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project can be used by the user at the time of rental apartment or buy house in a locality based on the distribution of various facilities available around the neighborhood. As an example, this project would compare 2 randomly picked neighborhoods and analyses the top 10 most common venues in each of those two neighborhoods based on the number of visits by people in each of those places. Also, this project uses K-mean clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster the venues based on the place category such as restaurants, park, coffee shop, gym, clubs etc. This would give a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two chosen neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood wins over other.\n",
